# Pewlett Hackard Analysis using SQL

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Our job is to help Pewlett Hackard determine how many employees are retiring per title and identify employees who can participate in their mentorship program. We will be checking to see how many employees are eligible for retirement. We will then provide metrics to better understand this data. We will show the titles of employees born between 1/1/52 and 12/31/55. 

## Results
- Most employees who are eligible for retirement have senior titles accounting for around 64%

- At least half of the retirees are under the "Engineer" title accounting for 50.2%
## Summary
There are a lot of roles that will need to be filled as employees begin to retire. A total of 90,398 will retire. With a total of about 300k employees, the amount retiring makes 30.1% which is a very big portion. 

When looking at if there are enough employees to mentor incoming employees, it is clear there are not enough. There are approximately 2 mentors for every 90 employees which is not a ratio that employees would be able to effectively learn and grow in. The best option would be to either hire more seasoned employees who can join the mentorship program, or to open it up to more employees in the company so that there will be enough mentors.
